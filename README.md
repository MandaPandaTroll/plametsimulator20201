Gravitational plametes, very nice


The attractor code is based on Brackeys' Gravity-Simulation-Tutorial


A simple gravity simulator created in unity.

It includes relativistic-like effects like relativistic mass and a half assed attempt to simulate time dilation (objects slow down as they approach the velocity limit).
